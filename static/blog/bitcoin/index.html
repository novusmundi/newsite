                            Late in 2008, at the height of what seemed to be the explosion of the traditional financial system, an email was sent to a group of cryptographers. This email was sent by somebody called Satoshi Nakamoto, and the description read, ¨Bitcoin: A peer to peer Electronic Cash System¨. This unknown entity that went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto had just made the whitepaper (a sort of roadmap) to Bitcoin public. This group of cryptographers had been trying to figure out how to build something like this for quite a while, and, as if it was sent by God himself, it arrived upon their hands. On January 12th 2009, the first Bitcoin transaction was sent from Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney. Still today, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, it may be a woman, a man, or most probably, a group of programmers that came up with a really original way of bringing their revolutionary invention to the world. Satoshi´s pseudonymity has greatly contributed to the folklore behind the Bitcoin revolution, with lots of people claiming to be him, and tons of speculation about who it might be. As of today, Satoshi Nakamoto´s wallet holds 1.1 million Bitcoins, which, with the price at the time of this writing is forty four billion USD.                            
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            Let's leave Satoshi alone for a bit to focus on what Bitcoin proposed and still proposes today. A peer to peer Electronic Cash system proposes a way to send currency without the need of the government or banks. Back then, if you wanted to transfer money to a certain individual, you were sending a currency whose value was determined by the Central Bank of the country you resided in, which could have a certain level of inflation depending on the economic circumstances of the World. In addition, you would have to go through a multinational corporation whose interest resided in getting a cut of the money you were holding in their entity and which completely lost their credibility (if they still had any) during the 2008 mortgage crisis. In addition your transactions were tracked by the government in order to get another cut when you performed your tax returns. Bitcoin proposed something completely different, no governments, no banks, no tax, no control. The value of the currency would be determined by the value that those buying it would give it. Satoshi´s cure for inflation was to set the maximum Bitcoin that could ever be emitted to  twenty one million Bitcoin, as opposed to the trillions that a country like the US can print in order to keep their economy afloat. As of today, 19 million are in circulation, and together they amount to around 840 billion United State Dollars. Not bad for a currency that would never have any value. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            Another concept that was almost pioneered by Bitcoin is the Open Source, which basically entails open code. You would think that technology that could have Trillions of dollars worth of value would probably be protected by patents and encrypted so no one could ever copy it right? Nope.  The whole code that makes Bitcoin is public and out there for anyone to see, copy, play around with to try to create their own blockchains, and all of this for free! Imagine Google and Facebook doing something like this? Yeah me neither.                            
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            The decentralization is made possible by the Proof of Work consensus mechanism and by an army of miners trying to make bitcoins by solving a puzzle in order to validate transactions. But, enough for today, we will leave that for another day.
