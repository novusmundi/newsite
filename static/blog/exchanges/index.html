                            Now that we know what cryptocurrencies are and what they consist of, we look at how to get your hands on them. If you want to do any kind of transaction within the Blockchain and start exploring the depths of the decentralized web you are most likely going to need some coins. The easiest way to get started with cryptocurrency trading is definitely centralized exchanges. We will give some examples of the most famous ones at the end of the blog, but chances are that you have already heard about some of them as they are not in the business of saving money in marketing and they seem to be everywhere, from the LA Lakers stadium name, to Times Square, Lewis Hamilton's car, or Coinbase doing an IPO that would rank it as the 5th bank in the world in terms of valuation, but that is not the point…                            
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            Anyways, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms through which you can buy cryptos with traditional money (Fiat) or with other cryptocurrencies. Exchanges basically act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and they make money, like traditional banks through commissions and transaction fees. You might think that this basically defeats the point of Web 3 which has as its main purpose to remove intermediaries and give power directly to the people. Well, yes it does, but the decentralized Web3 infrastructure is still very much in development and the User Experience of decentralized exchanges (we will talk about them soon, don´t worry) still has a long way to go to be ¨everyday internet¨ user friendly. This is why centralized exchanges are the most used by investors to buy and sell cryptocurrency holdings.                         
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            As mentioned before, they are ahead of decentralized exchanges for quite a few reasons. They have a simple interface and user experience, they allow for multiple payment options, like credit card, bank transfer, and even with other cryptocurrencies. In addition they usually do not charge any fees when you trade and operate inside of the exchange, only once you want to retrieve the funds from it and when you deposit money inside. But in my opinion, the reason why they have really gotten ahead is because they do not require you to create a decentralized wallet to then connect it to the exchange. (wallets are basically your identity within the blockchain). These exchanges require traditional verification, with your ID, so you do not need to do any extra steps, and you have a simple to use APP on your phone, in which you just have to click buy and sell to feel like the new Warren Buffet of cryptos.                        
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            Buuut, let us remember that we are not here to give publicity to non web3 apps, and these are definitely not decentralized, so let's speak about the cons of having or trading your money inside of these APPS. First of all you don't actually own the assets until you withdraw them from the exchange, just as in banks, if everybody was to withdraw at the same time they would never be able to give everyone their money. Your funds are used to approve different kinds of loans, pay commissions or taxes. These exchanges also have a limited amount of coins that they approve to sell within their application, favoring those cryptos that they prefer (or that might be more profitable for them?) over others. You will find the issue quite annoying as you might find out about really good opportunities that you can not access through these companies. We don't want to give them too much hate either as they have and are still helping Web3 assets become massively adopted, but it can happen as well that these applications suffer because of too much traffic on it. Restricting you from even seeing the state of your assets.
