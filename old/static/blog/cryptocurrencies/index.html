                            As we explained in the previous blog post about Blockchain, the first Blockchain also came with a new way to do financial transactions which you might have heard about.. Bitcoin. Before we go deeper into it in future posts, let's wrap our heads around what cryptocurrencies actually are. As its name states, a cryptocurrency is a digital currency which is secured by cryptography (the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents), this makes it virtually impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset that is based on a network which is distributed across a large number of computers (Blockchain). It is this decentralized structure that allows these coins to live outside the reach and control of governments and central authorities. If done without intermediaries like Coinbase or Binance, buying, selling or exchanging your coins should come without any fees and commissions like the ones that the banks charge you. The fees you will pay are called gas fees, and they are those that make the Blockchains´wheels go round, we will do a deeper explanation about it later.

                            You have probably encountered both sides within this world. Those that swear by the fact that cryptocurrencies are going to be the only way through which humanity will do transactions in the future. Then you have those that are absolutely sure that they are a scam which do not hold any value behind them and that they are only driven by speculative purposes by very rich individuals to make money from dumb people like you and me. The fact of the matter is that both are right and wrong. Firstly, cryptocurrencies have proven the skeptics that said you would never be able to pay anything with them wrong, this past year we have seen NBA players´ salaries paid in Bitcoin, houses bought, art auctions taking place in Ethers or tickets to events being sold as NFTs and even a country that has declared Bitcoin as one of their official currencies (El Salvador). In order for a currency to function, it needs to be accepted by both sides that do a transaction, and that is exactly what has happened. On the other hand, as of February 2022, there are more than 10 000 cryptocurrencies in circulation, and as you can imagine, the large majority of those do not actually hold any real value behind them.

                        <p class="mt-3">
                            I like thinking of cryptocurrencies, not simply as a coin to exchange between individuals. If you want to see whether these coins actually hold any value, you have to see them as shares to a company. Most of these coins have a utility in the Blockchain that they are emitted in, for example, Ether is used to buy NFTs and other products within the Ethereum blockchain, and to pay for the gas fees. Before buying Ether it is important to understand the dynamics and benefits of the Ethereum blockchain and the value of the project. If the coin you are buying does not have any project or utility apart from having been promoted by a football player or a rapper, you are almost for sure investing in a scam, and the coin, if it does not find a utility, will never have any value. One of the most important concepts in the Blockchain world is DYOR (Do Your Own Research), most of the information is public and you can check whether their promises are legit or not.                        
                        </p>  
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            These coins can have many shapes and forms in terms of utility. If you want to start exploring, I recommend you choose one project to focus on and really dip your feet in it.
